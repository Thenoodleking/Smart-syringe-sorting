## 基于无监督缺陷检测模型的医用注射器自动分拣系统
在医用注射器的实际生产过程中，难免面会出现划痕、墨圈、斑点等表面缺陷。然而，传统的人工分拣方法存在检测成本高、效率低和误检率高等问题。本课题基于深度无监督学习算法构造缺陷检测模型，并配合机械臂完成医用注射器异常样本的自动化分拣。该方法能够高效、准确的分拣出异常样品，同时降低缺陷检测成本，进一步提升企业生产效益。

## Automatic Sorting System for Medical Syringes Based on Unsupervised Defect Detection Model
During the actual production process of medical syringes, surface defects such as scratches, ink marks, and spots are inevitable. However, traditional manual sorting methods suffer from high detection costs, low efficiency, and high false detection rates. This project constructs a defect detection model based on deep unsupervised learning algorithms, and cooperates with a robotic arm to achieve automated sorting of abnormal medical syringe samples. This method can efficiently and accurately sort out abnormal samples, while reducing defect detection costs and further improving enterprise production efficiency.
